Synopsis:

This scripts is used to replace tandem duplications with one unit
For example, "a b a b a b" is replaced with "C C C", where C represents 
"a b". The cost file is adjusted to add respective new map units, such
as the "C" in the previous example.


Usage:
>processDoubleCopy.pl sequence_file costfile > output_seq_file

Note: - output_seq_file contains directed output sequence
      - the cost file is reported as "costfile.mod" in the same 
        directory as input cost file

# Bioinformatics
Pipeline project for CSU Plant Science Department
Coded by Rex Steele, CSU CS Junior
Project overseen by Alvaro PÃ©rez

To call the pipeline please be inside of the overarching directory, currently named Bioinformatics. Then from the command line
you can call it as follows (not including <>):

    python BioPip_V0.1.py <Name of Project> <path/to/FASTA/Files/> <Number of Processors>
    
    
Name of project must be a currently non-existant directory in the current working directory

Path to FASTA files needs to be the directory path relative to the current working directory. Currently set to use .fa files

Processors used is currently only set for Orthofinder, still in process of determining how to execute this.
